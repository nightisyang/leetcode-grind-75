## Comments

- Getting the hang of utilizing 2 or more pointers, recursion, traversing linked list, 2d matrix, binary search, binary search tree, trie, graphs.
- Have basic understanding of min/max heaps, LRU, adjacency list/matrix but do not have the intuition on when to use it.
- Too reliant on using recursion/DFS, not familiar with using queue and stack based approach.
- Need to further develop intuition to solve problems thorugh
  - Understanding the question
  - Looking for patterns in the data
  - **_ Write pseudocode PRIOR to coding it up _**
